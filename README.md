Smash Up Faction Efficiency Rating (SUFER)

This program is aiming to automate the collection of data from the website smashupdatabase.com and will automate a process that seeks to
calculate which Faction is the most efficient given said inputs.

It will automatically collect the most up to date data, this is the challenging part with the automation. The other difficult part is creating a proper SQL database
that will support what I am trying to do.

Finally I'm using a winforms application which is something I have historically struggled with.
